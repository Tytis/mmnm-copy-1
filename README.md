## What is this ?
This a changed version of the Mine Mine no Mi mod (original found here [https://pixelatedw.xyz/mine-mine-no-mi/downloads](https://pixelatedw.xyz/mine-mine-no-mi/downloads)) that adds couple of extra fruits

## Why is this here ?
Since the creators of this modified version refused to publish the code themselves under the license they've agreed upon I've decided, as the original author of the mod, to publish their code myself and take their server down for violation of the license.

## Notes
* I do not recommend using this code for development purposes, instead, if you truly wish to use 1.7.10, clone the official 1.7.10 version of the mod [https://github.com/PixelatedW/mineminenomi/tree/1.7.10](https://github.com/PixelatedW/mineminenomi/tree/1.7.10) and use this source as a reference point for their fruits (in the end you can do whatever you want this works either way)
* The original mod had a realyl douchbaggy protection against singleplayer found at src/main/java/xyz/pixelatedw/MineMineNoMi3/events/Soros.java **THIS HAS BEEN DISABLED** which means the released jar files can be used for singleplayer or for useage on other servers freely without any problems

## How to Install
1. Download and install MinecraftForge from their [official website](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
	* This Mod is made using 1.7.10 - 10.13.4.1614, so using that version or something higher than it is recommended
2. Download the latest .jar from the releases page
3. Create a new "mods" folder, if not already present, inside your ".minecraft" folder
    * On Windows the ".minecraft" folder can be found by pressing Windows Key + R and running the %appdata% command
    * On Linux it can be found inside the "~/.minecraft" directory
    * On macOS it can be found inside "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft" directory
4. Move the Mod file (the .jar file) inside this folder
5. Start Minecraft and choose the newly created "forge" profile
6. Enjoy
